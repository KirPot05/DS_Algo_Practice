// Siddhant made a special series and named it as G.F Series. The series follows this trend  Tn=(Tn-2)2-(Tn-1) in which the first and the second term are 0 and 1 respectively. Help Siddhant to find up to N terms of the series.

// Example 1:

// Input:
// N = 3
// Output:
// 0 1 -1
// Explanation:
// First-term is given as 0 and the second
// term is 1. So the T3 = (T3-2)2 - (T3-1)
// = T12 - T2 = 02 - 1 = -1
// Example 2:

// Input:
// N = 6
// Output:
// 0 1 -1 2 -1 5
// Explanation:
// first term : 0
// second term : 1
// third term : -1
// fourth term = (1)2 - (-1) = 2
// fifth term = (-1)2 - (2) = 1 - 2 = -1
// sixth term = (2)2 - (-1) = 4 + 1 = 5
